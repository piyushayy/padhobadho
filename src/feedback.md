You are acting as:

A Principal Product Designer

A Senior UX Engineer

A Conversion-focused EdTech Product Strategist

You are not designing a demo or template.
You are fixing and polishing a real, live EdTech startup website used by real students.

Product Context

Product name: Padhobadho
Domain: padhobadho.in
Category: EdTech — Competitive Exam Preparation
Initial Focus: CUET (expandable later)
Audience: Indian Gen-Z students (ages ~16–24)

These users are:

Distracted

Mobile-first

Skeptical of marketing

Outcome-oriented (scores, ranks, confidence)

Core Objective

Transform the website from:

“Clean but generic / AI-ish / unclear”

into:

“Focused, confident, exam-serious, human, and trustworthy.”

The website must clearly answer within 5 seconds:

What is this product?

Who is it for?

Why is it better than random practice or coaching apps?

What happens if I sign up?

What Is Working (Preserve & Build On)

You MUST keep and refine these strengths:

Clean typography foundation

Calm, modern color palette

Minimal, distraction-free vibe

Practice-first learning philosophy

Adaptive / streak-based motivation concept

Do not replace these with loud or gamified nonsense.

Major Problems to Fix (From Real User Feedback)
1. Messaging & Clarity (Highest Priority)

Problems:

Homepage does not clearly explain the product

Copy feels generic, abstract, or AI-generated

Headings resemble Brilliant / generic SaaS phrasing

Visuals (Python, logic cards) confuse exam-focused users

Users don’t know why they should sign up

Fix:

Rewrite all headings and subtext with:

Exam-specific language (CUET first)

Clear outcomes (accuracy, confidence, rank)

Simple, human, confident tone

Explain the product in concrete terms:

“Daily exam-level practice”

“Mistake-driven learning”

“Adaptive difficulty”

2. Visual Emptiness / Too Much White Space

Problems:

Excessive white background

Sections blend together

Page feels empty, unfinished, template-like

Fix:

Introduce subtle section separation:

Very light background tints

Soft gradients or noise textures

Alternating section backgrounds

Add gentle visual rhythm without clutter

Increase content density slightly (not visually noisy)

3. Navigation & Structure Issues

Problems:

No consistent global navigation

Footer missing on several pages

Pricing page locked behind login

No back navigation on some pages

Fix:

Add a persistent header + footer on every page

Public pricing page (no login required)

Clear nav structure:

Home

How It Works

Exams

Pricing

About

Login

Clear back buttons where needed

4. Mobile UX Problems (Critical)

Problems:

Back button overlaps logo on sign-in / sign-up

Auto-scrolling testimonials unreadable on mobile

Hover effects break on touch devices

Z-index and overflow issues

Fix:

Mobile-first layout audit

Replace auto-scroll testimonials with:

Swipeable cards

Clickable arrows

Fix stacking context and spacing

Ensure all CTAs are thumb-friendly

5. Visual Consistency & Design Language

Problems:

Typography styles clash

Button shapes don’t match font tone

Overuse of decorative icons

Feels like mixed design systems

Fix:

Choose ONE cohesive visual identity

Harmonize:

Fonts

Button shapes

Icon usage

Reduce unnecessary icons

Make the site feel intentionally designed, not assembled

6. Trust & Credibility Gaps

Problems:

Feels like a modified template

No strong sense of “this was built with intent”

Users hesitate before signing up

Fix:

Add clarity and confidence through:

“How it works” section

Exam-specific examples

Learning philosophy

Transparent pricing

Make the site feel human and deliberate

Required Outcomes

You must deliver:

A redesigned homepage structure

Fully rewritten copy (headings + subtext)

Clear visual hierarchy

Mobile-first usability fixes

Consistent navigation and footer system

Removal of any copied or derivative language

Tone & Style Guidelines

Calm, focused, and confident

Gen-Z friendly but not cringe

Serious about learning outcomes

Minimal, intentional, human

Avoid:

Buzzwords

Vague inspiration talk

Generic SaaS marketing language

Non-Negotiable Rule

Do NOT output a generic template.
This is a real product with real users and a real mission.

Design as if:

“This will be audited by senior designers and used by thousands of students.”

Final Instruction

Think deeply before making changes.
Design with intention, not decoration.
Every section must justify its existence.
